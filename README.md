**Description** Father sent you to get some car batteries for some good reason. But you know only one place where you can get this stuff - garage park.

Your goal is to steal 5 car batteries from this location and bring them to the gates of this garage park. Beware of angry mobs. They are quite fast as well as stupid. But You have a superpower! You can scale... hm.. shrink yourself to pass the narrow spaces between garages (in some cases). So they won't get you there.

**Controls:**

WSAD, Space, Left Shift - for movement

E - for picking up the car batteries (red boxes), and also you can regulate the throwing by mouse wheel

Left mouse - throw

Q - shrink yourself

Some little advices: pay attention to your stamina (green bar), you can run fast only for a short period of time. You can't bring the battery when you shrunk. In that case try to drop it as far as you can. It takes only one touch for those angry guys to bust you.
All the assets except of apartment blocks I created myself.
